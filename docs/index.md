# Getting Started

Welcome to Olin's PInT Out Maine subteam's official/unnoficial documentation site! Here you'll be able to find documentation specifc to our subteam(i.e how we mantain our github repository). If you're ever lost about a certain script or how to reinstall an application, come here!

_Note: This is maintained by Kenneth Xiong '27. There are some things that are missing because I forgot about them, or I don't understand how they work. If there's an error or something missing, feel free to reach [out](mailto:kxiong@olin.edu)._

## Installing Unity
_We use version **2020.3.32f1** of Unity. Any other version will not be able to open the project._

1. Go to [https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) and download version **2020.3.32f1** of Unity for you os(runder 2020.x tab). **DO NOT OPEN THE FILE YET!**

2. Download Unity Hub.

3. Open Unity Hub FIRST. Follow the prompts to create a new account. 

## Installing Github
_You might be thinking "I'm not a programmer, I don't need this," get it :3_

1. Download **Git** for your os [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Run the file with default settings. Make sure that git is added to your computer's PATH.
3. Download *Github Desktop* [here](https://docs.github.
com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).

    _This step is **not** optional for advanced users. Unity is not command line friendly when it comes merging branches._

4. Run the installation file and log in.

    _If you haven't already now is a good time to create a github account._

5. Select "Clone a Repository from the Internet".  Paste "https://github.com/lilibaker/outmaine.git" into the space for a web adress. Make note of file path that the repository has been copied to. You will need it in the next step.

    _If this throws an error, reach out to Kenneth. You don't have access to the repository(oops!)._  

6. Open Unity Hub. Click "Add Project" and select "From Disk". Nagivate to where you cloned repository earlier. If everything was setup correctly, the project should open in Unity. YAY!!!!

## Installing Photoshop

_Different from past semesters, we will be using photoshop to create our pixel art. Fun Fact! Olin gives all students access to the entire Adobe suite._

1. Self explanatory. Download Adobe Creative Cloud(if you haven't already). Install Photoshop.

That's it! You're now ready to start designing :)
