# Creating Sprites

There are two ways we go about this. 

1. Copy and paste an existing sprite and edit it(I suggest this especially for the player).

2. Create a scene from scratch(see below).

## Sprite from Scratch

1. To create a sprite. Go to the "Game Object," click "Create Empty." Name it whatever, make sure it's between Main Camera and Grid in the heirarchy window. Then in the Inpsector click "add component." Look up "Sprite Renderer." Under the "sprite" option, click the circle with a dot in it and select an artwork to be the sprite.

2. Add all the necessary scripts, colliders, rigidbodies, etc.
